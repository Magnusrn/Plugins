### Birdhouse-Infobox
Starts a (fairly conservative) timer upon building a birdhouse, overlays an infobox

### Cox Raid Scouter

SWIM ran this on 3 accounts for a little under 3 months(approx 2000 raids) two temps towards the end. However this is a commonly reported activity so would only recommend using on burner accounts. Works nicely if setup on a cloud VM and webhooked to discord. Only need to check once every 6 hours if using the auto leave/rejoin cc feature

Example Desired Rotations: [Tekton,Vasa,Guardians],[Muttadiles,Shamans,Mystics],[Guardians,Vasa,Tekton],[Vasa,Tekton,Vespula],[Vespula,Tekton,Vasa],[Mystics,Shamans,Muttadiles],[Tekton,Muttadiles,Guardians],[Guardians,Muttadiles,Tekton],[Muttadiles,Vespula,Guardians],[Vespula,Guardians,Muttadiles] 

Example Blacklisted Rooms: Unknown (puzzle),Unknown (combat),Ice Demon,Vanguards

### One Click Blast Furnace 
***If doing gold must prefill the hopper with 27 gold***
Setup bank with fillers as you would normally do blast furnace, so you can deposit all.
Needs staminas(probably one dose and 4 dose, but definitely at least one dose, it'll drink four doses if your run energy depletes to below 20, else drinks 1 dose at 80 run).
Must be in the main part of the bank and not a tab. Set withdraw quantity to one(not sure if this matters tbh)  
Supports gold but it might be losing 40xp each run if you're not clicking quickly, or maybe just depends on speed of the belt at the moment.
This is not perfect, but seems to work p well. 

### One Click Bloods
Initially requires the map to be loaded as a normal player would else it can get stuck. Currently uses a rather inelegant method of using a chisel on the cluster of rocks to get nearer to the altar, very open to suggestions on how to solve this as walking programatically seems very aids. SWIM has used for approx 100h without any detection.

### One Click Glassblowing
Supports two banks, Clan hall and north of Fossil Island. Ensure you're in the main bank tab(Not sure why this is required)

### One Click Karambwans
Ensure last destination on fairy ring is DKP. Currently supports banking at zanaris only, works with or without Fish Barrel.

### One Click Minnows
Made this very quickly, haven't tested much, seems to do the job.

### One Click Sandstone
Ensure you have waterskins in your invent and humidify runes. If you run out of water it will cast humidify. Should add a check or toggle for this but if you run out and you don't have humidify you're dead soon anyway.

### One Click Telegrab
Supports telegrabbing Wine of Zamorak at the wildy spot or the safe chaos altar.

### One Click ZMI
This is state based so must be started near the banker at ZMI. Ensure you have 1 dose staminas in the bank and are in the main tab of the bank with the withdraw quantity set to 1. Ensure Last NPC contact was to dark mage as it will repair broken pouches. Only supports Medium/Medium + Large/Medium + Large + Giant pouches.
